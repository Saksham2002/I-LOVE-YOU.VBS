# I-LOVE-YOU.VBS
## NOTE .ZIP VERSION IS WORKING RIGHT NOW ONLY!!!
This repo is dedicated towards the legendary I-LOVE-YOU.VBS worm which spread around the world on May 4th, 2000. The reason for having this repo is due to the fact that all the codebase avaialbale for the worm right now is either corrupted or facing formatting issues in text due to which the worm was no longer working. I have added my modified copy of the worm which is totally working and tested.
